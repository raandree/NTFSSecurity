# NTFSSecurity

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/2gfb58t9qh655b8x?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Sup3rlativ3/ntfssecurity) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/ntfssecurity/badge/?version=latest)](https://ntfssecurity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Managing file & folder permissions with PowerShell is only a bit easier than in VBS or the command line as there are no cmdlets for most day-to-day tasks like getting a permission report or adding permission to an item. PowerShell only offers Get-Acl and Set-Acl but everything in between getting and setting the ACL is missing. This module closes the gap.
